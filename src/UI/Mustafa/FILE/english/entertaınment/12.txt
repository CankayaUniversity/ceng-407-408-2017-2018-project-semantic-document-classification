The proposals will go before the council's cabinet on 20 April, ahead of a public consultation in the autumn.Liverpool City Council is proposing a regeneration area around Mathew Street, where the Cavern Club - which hosted the band's early shows - once stood.The council said the city's "Beatles-related industry" had been growing at up to 15% annually in the last decade and was worth 90m a year.The council spokesman said the plan would include the granting of compulsory purchase powers and be based on the findings of a "scrutiny panel" review of the area.The aim was to bring an "enhanced and more co-ordinated Beatles tourism offer" to the area, the council said.Source: The Cavern ClubThe alternative "do nothing option" would result in "a missed opportunity to capitalise on the Beatles offer and connect with the wider city music offer", the report said.City Mayor Joe Anderson said there was a need to improve the area's 24-hour appeal as the current offer was "not at the level it could and should be".Mr Anderson said there was a "unique" chance to "establish an experience no other city can offer and one which will sustain thousands of jobs, for generations to come".If approved, the regeneration work would focus on the area from Victoria and North John Street to Lord Street and Stanley Street.A spokesman said Cavern City Tours and the Cavern Club, the venue built on the site of its namesake nightclub using the original plans, now attracted 800,000 visitors a year.The plans could involve the redevelopment of derelict and under-used buildings and the creation of a "more defined and useable public open space".However, a report to the council said visitors were "increasingly looking for a quality experiential visit" and there was "a clear need to curate a Beatles Heritage offer".
