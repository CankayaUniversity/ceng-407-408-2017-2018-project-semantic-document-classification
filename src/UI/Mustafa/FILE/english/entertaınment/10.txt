Mr Cosby, 80, is only criminally accused of assaulting one woman - former Temple university employee Andrea Constand - due to statute of limitation laws.He allegedly responded: "You're crazy," she said. "Here was America's dad on top of me, happily married man with five children and how very, very wrong it was," she said.Mr Cosby's lawyers pointed out she authored a memoir in 2002 that made no mention of the assault, and read a passage in which she wrote she had never entered Mr Cosby's room and took two quaaludes in her own room. Mr Cosby is facing a second trial on allegations he drugged and sexually assaulted a former colleague, and has been accused by more than 50 women.She said she confronted the comedian the next day about the incident and asked him why he did it. She added she "wasn't under oath" when she wrote the book."He smelled like cigars and espresso and his body odour," she said. "I couldn't move, I felt like I was rendered motionless."Last June, a Pennsylvania judge declared a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict.The star of The Cosby Show was once the biggest name in US television, synonymous with wholesome family entertainment, and a Hollywood trailblazer for African Americans.Ms Dickinson, who was 27 at the time, said she had flown from Bali to meet the famous comedian at a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, after he promised to help with her acting and singing aspirations."I wanted to hit him, wanted to punch him in the face," Ms Dickinson, 63, told the courtroom in Norristown, Pennsylvania. "I felt anger, was humiliated, disgusted, ashamed."The judge has allowed five women to take the stand during the retrial. The former reality television star testified Mr Cosby offered her a blue pill that he said would help with discomfort from menstrual cramps.But Judge Steven O'Neill has ruled that five other accusers can serve as "prior bad acts" witnesses, which the prosecution says will establish a pattern of misconduct.Ms Dickinson said she did not go to police because she thought it would destroy her career. She "wanted to punch him in the face" after the alleged attack and was left in physical pain, she told the court.On Monday it emerged that Mr Cosby paid Ms Constand almost $3.4m (2.4m) in a civil settlement in 2006. Ms Dickinson told the court she was advised to leave the assault out of the book for legal reasons and felt pressured to do so because she needed the money.
