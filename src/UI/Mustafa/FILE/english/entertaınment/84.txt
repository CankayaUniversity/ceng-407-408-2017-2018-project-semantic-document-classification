Ingram maintained his innocence throughout his court trial. Now, West End audiences are (literally) being asked to decide for themselves whether or not he was guilty - by voting via a keypad at the end of both the first and second half."I was a lone naysayer for Quiz's Chichester premiere, finding the play frantic and unfocused," she said. Several of Graham's plays - such as Ink, This House and Labour of Love - have been staged in London over the last two years, cementing his status as one of the industry's most prolific and sought-after current playwrights."Quiz manages to register the personal tragedy of the Ingrams, analyse the notion of fair play, touch on present politics, overflow with information and ideas  - and to be huge fun," he wrote. "Another hit for Graham? No question."Charles Ingram, a former British Army major, was accused of cheating his way to the jackpot on the ITV show by conspiring with his wife, Diana, and another contestant, who would apparently cough when the correct answer was mentioned.Speaking to BBC News after the show's London premiere, director Daniel Evans says: "I'm feeling very relieved, because it was a nerve-wracking evening."We put audience members on stage to replicate the studio conditions from the TV show," Evans says."Not because we weren't happy with what happened in Chichester, but you learn so much when you do a tryout for a show, so we streamlined the narrative, I reordered some of the structure, we had to think about a West End proscenium Victorian theatre, which is very different to a studio theatre in Chichester. "But I think the story about whether or not a few middle class people tried to steal a million pounds with questions and coughing, feels like the most British crime of all time. And almost ludicrous in its simplicity."There is a script, we have a director, we have a channel, we'll start shooting, we think, over the summer," he says.

When it was playing in Chichester, The Telegraph advised readers to "phone a friend and go," while The Stage described it as "a fascinating, multi-textured and very entertaining play".But Alun Hood of WhatsOnStage said: "Quiz is a lot of fun but it lacks the warmth, clarity and sometimes surprising emotionalism of Graham's finest work," he said."And we've now focused it down. We now know that it's very much about the campaign behind the scenes, so we go behind the scenes of the Leave and the Remain offices.The results, of course, vary each night - but Evans and Graham both say that audiences generally vote guilty after hearing the prosecutors' case, but are more likely to take Ingram's side after hearing the defence.Several changes have been made as a result, and the show is now more ambitious."It's not perfect now - there are still too many distracting bells and whistles; tantalising ideas are left hanging - but it's sharper and more streamlined and, vitally, more sure of its central thesis: what is 'true' when so many aspects of modern life have become a type of blended reality?"Writing for The Independent, Paul Taylor also awarded it four stars."Also, so many people involved in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire came to see it, and they called me, asked to meet up, and I learned new stuff, new facts, new anecdotes, so it evolved because of that as well."In 2016, Graham revealed he was also working on a TV drama about Brexit - a project he now confirms should hit screens before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Quiz, which transferred to London's Noel Coward Theatre this week after a run in Chichester last year, has received broadly positive reviews from critics.After the show's London press night on Tuesday, Fiona Mountford awarded it four out of five stars in her review for The Evening Standard.It's a case of quite literally asking the audience."There were many challenges bringing it from Chichester, because the Minerva theatre is a 300-seater, whereas the Noel Coward is a 900-seater."Graham explains: "[Tarrant] came to see the show in Chichester. He came in disguise so we didn't know he was there. The actors knew when he was leaving because his driver was there."Will Graham reveal his own thoughts on Ingram's guilt or innocence? "I wouldn't dare," he laughs.Graham, meanwhile, estimates that around 40% of the play has been rewritten between its staging in Chichester and London.Quiz is playing now at London's Noel Coward Theatre.Presenter Chris Tarrant left little doubt about his own feelings towards Ingram this week, writing in The Daily Mail that he was "guilty as sin".
