The "potentially toxic" fumes were emitted from coral being cleared from an aquarium at a house Hanney Road, Steventon, on Monday evening."In the main they're absolutely harmless but sometimes if you stress certain types of coral, they can produce a toxin," he said.Scientist Dr Mike Leahy said the people were probably exposed to "palytoxins" released by the coral.About 50 emergency services personnel attended, including a hazardous area response team and three ambulances.Six members of a family and four firefighters were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and three family members were kept in overnight after suffering "flu-like symptoms" and eye irritation.TV presenter Dr Leahy said he was caught inside the police cordon while visiting his mother, who lives on the same road.Went for a cuppa with Mum.  When I left confronted by this. Trapped within police cordon. Palytoxin incident due to a neighbour cleaning his coral tank. Second deadliest naturally occurring toxin in the world (allegedly) but rarely kills, & only if eaten!
