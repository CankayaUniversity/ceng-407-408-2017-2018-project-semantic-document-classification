"My babies will always exist to me because I carried them, but a death certificate is official - it says to the world that they existed."When a pregnancy ends before 24 weeks gestation, there is no formal process for parents to legally register the loss.Ms Collinge, who is based at University Hospital in Coventry, said: "There is a real lack of understanding around baby loss, and in particular with babies that are born before the 24-week age viability".The review will be led by bereavement specialist and midwife Sam Collinge.It was announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt earlier this year.Mrs Mbarouk, 30, said: "To have something like this, as a memory, is something you can hold on to forever.Salma Mbarouk, 30, from Coventry, was unable to register 12 of the babies as they were miscarried before the current 24-week threshold.Ms Collinge will work with the charity Saying Goodbye to look at how services can be improved for parents who experience a miscarriage and other causes of baby loss."Sam looked after us in the darkest of hours and I cannot think of someone more compassionate than her to lead this."Mrs Mbarouk said if parents could get a certificate it would be "amazing"."If we had a certificate and if it was registered in a system - type it in and their name is there; it would be so amazing. At the moment, parents whose babies are stillborn after 24 weeks gestation can register the name and receive a certificate of registration of stillbirth.
