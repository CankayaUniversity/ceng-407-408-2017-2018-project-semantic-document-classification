Steve Crowther was then acting leader until Mr Bolton was elected in September."We are essentially a volunteer organisation and we have a difficult task ahead; one which will require a lot of commitment and work," he said."I will not make any extravagant promises.Mr Batten said as interim leader he had "made a number of decisions that have put the party on a firm footing financially and organisationally".He took over from Henry Bolton in February after a racism row saw Mr Bolton ousted from the party.While there have been four different UKIP leaders since the referendum, the leadership has changed hands six times. Mr Batten took over after a row in which Mr Bolton's girlfriend Jo Marney was expelled from the party following allegations she had sent racist messages about Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiance.He is the fourth person to lead UKIP in 19 months, as the party's popularity has crumbled since the EU referendum.Mr Batten said he will "concentrate on doing all I can to restore the party's fortunes.""UKIP is the only real opposition to our political establishment, and we are needed now as much as ever," he said.The MEP, who had been interim leader since February. said that as he was elected unopposed he would step down so a full contest can take place.Nigel Farage, the party's most famous figure, stepped down after the Brexit vote, only to resume his post when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm.The party has also suffered a funding crisis and was saved from insolvency by public donations.He added that the party needs to get "back into the political fight" with the upcoming local elections.
