They have amassed huge amounts of data needed to train AI-based systems and "must be prevented from becoming overly powerful" it said.It also recommends that more is done to protect people's data rights and choices in an age of AI.The committee says the adoption of its recommendations would mean the UK is "ready, willing and able to take advantage of AI."AI should "never" be given the "autonomous power to hurt, destroy or deceive" people, it adds."Many jobs will be enhanced by AI, many will disappear and many new, as yet unknown jobs, will be created," the report said.The Lords' report said the UK has the potential to be a leader in developing AI and called on the government to support businesses in the field. "Retraining will become a lifelong necessity."It named Google, IBM and Microsoft as the current leaders in the field and said there was a danger that the fast-growing industry would be monopolised by those few. It said that such education would "mitigate the negative effects" on jobs which are possible as AI develops.The report also warned of the danger of AI becoming dominated by a few big firms. "Significant government investment in skills and training will be necessary," it added.It also recommended that people be educated to work alongside AI in the jobs of the future.Lord Clement-Jones, the committee's chair, said the UK has "a unique opportunity to shape AI positively for the public's benefit" and to lead on international development standards, rather than "passively" accepting the consequences of such development.The House of Lords Artificial Intelligence Committee's report - AI in the UK: Ready, Willing and Able? - concludes that AI "should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity".This could include establishing a voluntary mechanism to inform people when AI is being used."The UK contains leading AI companies... as well as a host of legal, ethical, financial and linguistic strengths. We should make the most of this environment," he said.Despite the stark warning there was no need to create an AI-regulator to rein in those tech giants, said the report. Instead regulators in other industries should be aware of the growing use of AI in their sector, such as insurance, and act accordingly.
