Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti says the government did not meet its own tests for launching an airstrike in Syria over the weekend.She told the Today programme: "I don't think the government can demonstrate convincing evidence and a general acceptance by the international community that they had to act in the way they did a few days ago."
