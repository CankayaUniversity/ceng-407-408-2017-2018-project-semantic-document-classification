The court found that Mr Elam was liable for the injuries caused by his "systematic revenge porn campaign" and ordered him to pay damages. Legal firm K&L Gates fought the case as part of the firm's Cyber Civil Rights Project, which helps victims of revenge porn for reduced fees.In order to get the content removed, Ms Doe was forced to copyright her image and serve take-down notices to the many different sites on which they were uploaded.Soon after the relationship broke down, say the papers, Mr Elam threatened to "ruin the life" of Ms Doe and uploaded the images to several social media networks, porn websites and dating services.Ms Doe sent intimate images and videos to Mr Elam while the pair were in a relationship but were living far apart in the US. Court documents seen by the BBC reveal that David Elam and Jane Doe, the pseudonym given to the woman in the case, met via an online dating site in 2012.The judgement was made in a civil suit as a federal criminal case against Mr Elam was dropped in 2014.As a result of this activity, the court papers say, Ms Doe "has continually feared for her physical safety".The award compensates for the harm done by sharing the images, stalking, emotional distress and copyright infringement.The unnamed woman sued ex-boyfriend David K Elam II after he put naked videos and pictures of her online."Revenge porn is a very serious violation of someone's rights and can lead to very serious injuries that are worthy of being redressed," said Seth Gold from K&L Gates in an interview with CNN Money.Mr Elam is also alleged to have impersonated Ms Doe on these sites and encouraged others to send her sexual images. He also shared her mobile number and home address with anyone who responded.
