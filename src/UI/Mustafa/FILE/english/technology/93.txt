Some recipients of the alert had questioned if it was real, as the email address it had been sent from seemed unusual.@GWRHelp Hi - is this a genuine e-mail as the address is service@e.firstgreatwestern.co.uk? Seems to have an erroneous e after the @ in the e-mail address. Thanks. pic.twitter.com/dO42fQMaso"We have identified unauthorised automated attempts to access a small number of GWR.com accounts over the past week," a spokesman told the BBC.Great Western Railway said that about 1,000 of its passengers' details had been exposed."I would suspect that is what is happening here, and that GWR accounts have been accessed by people trying their luck with stolen credentials," said Ms Knowles.The firm added that the decision to reset all customer accounts had been taken as a precautionary step."Hackers know that consumers use the same passwords for multiple accounts, and that these credentials will open doors into emails, banks, or in this case railway accounts.It said all bank information had been protected by encryption."While we were able to shut this activity down quickly and contact those affected, a small proportion of accounts were successfully accessed."The success rate of the automated logins was extremely low, suggesting any passwords used were likely harvested elsewhere," the company added.One cyber-security expert said the incident served as a reminder that people should use a different, complex password for each online service they used.The business - which runs trains between London, Penzance and Worcester - is part of the transport operator FirstGroup."In the wake of large data breaches, we often see large caches of credentials go on sale on the dark web," commented Rashmi Knowles from RSA Security.
