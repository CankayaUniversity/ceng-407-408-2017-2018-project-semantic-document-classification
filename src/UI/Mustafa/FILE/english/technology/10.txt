The privacy-focused Open Rights Group welcomed the changes.Apple has previously promoted its services and smartphones as being privacy-focused.Apple also plans to let people download the data it has stored about them.Apple also plans to release new tools in May that will let customers:"The new rules have forced everyone to make changes, including some of the big US-based companies. That's a victory for privacy and it shows that we can win improvements if governments listen to people's well-founded concerns about privacy."Tapping the notice will display detailed information about what data is being collected and how it is used.The latest software update does not change how much data is collected, but new privacy information screens will appear when people use certain Apple-made apps for the first time.After updating, customers will see new information screens when they use Apple-made apps that collect personal data, such as App Store."Making privacy settings more transparent and giving people more control is better. This is happening because companies are checking what they are doing before new data protection rules kick in," said Jim Killock.The change comes ahead of new EU data protection rules, which take effect on 25 May.However, customers will not be able to switch off some types of data collection. For example, they will not be able to download free apps from the App Store without first setting up an Apple ID account. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) toughens the requirements on how organisations handle the public's data, and imposes harsher penalties for breaches.
