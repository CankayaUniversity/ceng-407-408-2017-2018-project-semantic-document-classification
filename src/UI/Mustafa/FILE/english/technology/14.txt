The median gender bonus pay gap at the business is 41.5%, according to figures submitted to the government.That means half the staff will earn less than the median salary, and half the staff will earn more. "Technical roles generally have a higher market rate than other positions due to their more specialised skills, but also the higher rate of demand for those skills in the marketplace," said Fiona Mullan, the company's human resources chief for Europe, the Middle East and Africa."This is a societal issue.""And the same would be true for leadership positions."She said the company hoped to tackle the discrepancy, but that would involve more females being encouraged to study relevant subjects at school and university.Since there are often fewer women in higher-paying roles than men, the median can better reflect the typical experience of men and women at a business.The median is worked out by putting every person's salary in order from highest to lowest, and focusing on the salary right in the middle of the range.However, the mean can also be a useful way of reflecting the lack of women in high-paying roles."It really requires a back-to-basics approach, and will require more than the efforts of Facebook to change fundamentally the difference between the representation of men and women in the workplace particularly in technical careers," said Ms Mullan.Its data states that 87.8% of its male workers received a bonus payment, compared with 86.3% of its female employees.Companies are required to report their pay gap in two ways: mean and median.The mean is worked out by adding every person's salary together and dividing by the total number of employees. That means when comparing median hourly rates, Facebook's female staff earn 90p for every 1 that its men earn.However, the equivalent gap for hourly pay was much smaller - 9.9%.The inclusion of a highly paid chief executive can make the average salary at a business appear much higher than it is, since the highest paid staff in a business typically earn much more than the lowest paid workers. That headline figure compares favourably to Google UK, which reported a 16% median hourly rate gender pay gap earlier this week. It told the BBC that part of the reason there was such a big gap in the amount they received was because a higher proportion of its engineering teams and top-level executives were male than in other areas of the business.Organisations with more than 250 workers have until 4 April to publish their own pay gap data. The figures are accessible to the public via a government website. Facebook employs about 1,500 people in the UK.
