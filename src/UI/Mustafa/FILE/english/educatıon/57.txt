His name became associated with the terrible casualties of battles such as the Somme.The two families' names remain synonymous with World War One.His grandson, Mr Becourt-Foch's father, fought and died with the Free French in North Africa in World War Two.Both Mr Becourt-Foch and Lord Astor emphasise the need to maintain the partnership between British and French military forces.And while diplomatically stepping around the Brexit debate, he says the era after World War Two has helped to build "European unity"."It cannot be a good thing. But we were attacked by the Germans, we had to defend ourselves," he said.Haig's reputation has been under constant revision, following the historical cycle of being revered, reviled and then rehabilitated.His great-grandson, Eric Becourt-Foch, was at the ceremony along with Lord Astor, grandson of one of most famous figures of the war, Field Marshal Douglas Haig.  The Haig Fund used to be printed on remembrance poppies. In towns and villages across France there are thousands of streets named after Foch.The ceremony in London marked the point when a common leadership was needed by the Western allies, with Foch's appointment backed by Haig."My mother was very affected - she was only eight when her father died - and she was shaken by some of the stories about him.Lord Astor says his grandfather was highly respected by his soldiers and later criticism failed to recognise how much he was admired at the time.These personal accounts, remembering the faces in grainy photographs and names on headstones, are usually of ordinary soldiers who fought in the trenches."A lot of the focus has been on the problems - Passchendaele and the Somme - but we also should focus on the victories.""They wouldn't have done that if he was unpopular," adds Lord Astor.As the commemorations approach for the last stages of the war, Lord Astor says: "I think my main reason for remembering is for all the dead, there were very few families that didn't lose a member."Within the first month of the war his only son had died in battle. On the same day in August 1914, his son-in-law, Mr Becourt-Foch's grandfather, was also killed.The ancestors of these two men sent colossal armies into battle, with casualties on a scale not seen before or since. They literally had the fates of millions of lives in their hands.Mr Becourt-Foch says that when his great-grandfather went to receive the baton of field marshal from King George V, the conversation was in French. Foch, now in charge of British forces, spoke little English, but King George V was able to speak French.His grandson, Lord Astor, says there was a strong mutual respect between the two commanders. "He cried all the way through the funeral.""I accept mistakes were made - but they learned from their mistakes and they built on them and we won the war in the end," said Lord Astor. But now, says Mr Becourt-Foch, there is also "strong reconciliation" with Germany. There are two more major commemorative events this year - marking the centenary of the Battle of Amiens and the armistice. Descendants of those who fought at Amiens can apply for tickets for a commemorative service in Amiens to be held on 8 August."But by the time she'd died, a lot of that had changed," he said."He was revered in his lifetime. When he died, there were two million people on the streets of London."Mr Becourt-Foch said his great-grandfather had his "own share of sacrifice" and their family has never been sheltered from the loss of war.The soldiers who had served under him lined the routes of his funeral, he says.But a ceremony in London this week brought together descendants of two of the most iconic commanders from the war, the decision-makers whose orders sent millions into battle.He defends his grandfather's approach to the war - as he commanded an army of two million men.Were they distant from the suffering of the front-line soldiers?"We defeated the most powerful army in the world, the German army, and we should record that with pride.The connection continued after the war. Marshal Foch was a pall bearer at the funeral of Field Marshal Haig in 1928.They knew that the Germans would try to divide the allies, strategically and militarily, so Mr Becourt-Foch says his great-grandfather had to keep British and French forces together, "whatever it costs"."He was accused of not being defensive enough, but what was the alternative - to sit in the trenches? You had to try and break out somewhere."The posthumous criticism of Haig hurt his family.The ceremony in London was held at the statue of Marshal Foch near to Victoria Station - and marked the stage in the war in 1918 when the Western allies switched to a single, co-ordinated command to take on the Germans.This latest war commemorations mark the point 100 years ago when a French marshal, Ferdinand Foch, was made supreme allied commander on the Western Front.
